The video in the link above can be followed for an example of how to run our code. Alternatively, below are detailed instructions on how to run our main file backend.py.

## Running Frontend

### Run on Terminal
#### Run the following commands (Once the main file is opened):
###### cd my-app
###### npm start

### What should happen?
1. A new tab on your internet browser with the URL “localhost:3000” will appear, with the web page titled “ML Model Frontend”
2. Go back to the code and run. The terminal will appear with the server is running - “Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000”
3. Go back to the web page. Now users can input data into the designated fields into the input fields to generate a prediction for median housing prices.

## Running Backend

### Run on a new Terminal tab
#### Create a new terminal tab
#### Run the following command (Once a new terminal tab is created):
###### python backend.py
