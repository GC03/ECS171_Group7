The video in the link above can be followed for an example of how to run our code. Alternatively, below are detailed instructions on how to run our main file backend.py.

## On Terminal
### When the main file is opened run the following on Terminal:
cd my-app
npm start

## What should happen?
1. A new tab on your internet browser with the URL “localhost:3000” will appear, with the web page titled “ML Model Frontend”
2. Go back to the code and run. The terminal will appear with the server is running - “Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000”
3. Go back to the web page. Now filters can be entered into the input fields for a median housing price prediction to be generated.
